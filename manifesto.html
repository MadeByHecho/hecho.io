    <h1>Hecho.</h1>
    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <p>I never really thought I'd write a manifesto, but I thought explaning what I'm trying to do would be good for the both of us.</p>
    <p>I want to <em>make things</em>. I want to make great things simple. I want to build sustainable things.</p>  
    <p>I want to sell the things I make, not my users data.</p>
    <p>All that is fine but what does it actually mean in practice.  It means I want to build an app for iOS 8 and be adding features in iOS 12. It means I actually want to know who's buying my apps and for them to know who's developing them.</p>
    <p>All these things may seem naive, particularly with the App Store being the race to the bottom that it is. Time may prove that it is, but until it does, I'm going to make things.</p>
